	<question>This equation shares the same dynamics as a circle of equally spaced balls colored black or white, which move in a clockwise direction at the same speed and change color whenever they pass a mark on the circle; that construction is the Kac ring model. Applying time-reversal invariance to this equation can be used to show that it is only strictly valid when the integral over velocity space of f times the natural log of f is at a local maximum. The derivation of this equation assumes that the velocities and positions of molecules are statistically independent, a condition called “molecular chaos.” For a gas of particles which only interact via binary collisions, this equation gives an expression for the time evolution of the non-equilibrium distribution function. The H-theorem is derived using, for 10 points, what “transport equation” of statistical mechanics, named for a scientist who proposed a logarithmic formula for entropy?</question>

	<question>Saari decomposition was used by to discover “remarkable” solutions to this problem by Chenciner and Montgomery. In a method similar to constructing Cantor’s ternary set, Jeff Xia proved that this problem admits the existence of certain singularities first conjectured by Painlevé (“PAHN-luh-vee”). Jack Wisdom and his student Matthew Holman proposed a symplectic map for this problem that combines basic motion in terms of Gauss’ f and g functions with kicks from the interaction Hamiltonian. In 1992, Babadzanjanz (“bab-adze-AN-jans”) showed that his earlier 1979 paper had obtained a global solution to this problem that was concurrently done using the notions of blowing up transformation and regularization by Qiudong Wang. This problem can be solved (*) computationally using only dark matter to trace the formation of large-scale structure.  This problem is only analytically solvable for less than three particles. For 10 points, name this problem of finding the trajectories for an arbitrary number of particles experiencing a central force.</question>

	<question>Undesirable components of this quantity are eliminated with Lowdin annihilators. Naaman et al discovered that layers of stearoyl lysine are able to “select” for this quantity, an effect known as its namesake chiral-induced selectivity. The expectation value of the square of this quantity is used to detect its namesake contamination, which is eliminated by using restricted open-shell Hartree–Fock. Two times this quantity plus one equals this quantity’s multiplicity, which is the leading superscript of a term symbol. Pascal’s triangle is used to determine peak splitting due to coupling of this quantity between non-equivalent protons in H1 NMR. The lowest energy state is the one that maximizes the total amount of this quantity according to Hund’s first rule, which is why orbitals are singly-occupied before pairing.
